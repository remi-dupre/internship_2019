  The problem of membership for regular languages is a well understood problem,
  automata-based techniques. However, few efforts have been made to enumerate
  all matches of a regexp over a text, most tools used to match regexps only
  seek for one output, some like grep are intended to find any line containing
  a match, it sometime appends that an option is available to list all
  non-overlapping matches.

  Enumeration techniques are widely used in database theory, in order to deal
  with large datasets, it seems relevant to try applying theses techniques for
  the problem of enumerating matches over a text, which could result on a
  quadratic output for large input documents.

\subsection*{The research problem}

  % What is the question that you studied ?
  % Why is it important, what are the applications/consequences ?
  % Is it a new problem ?
  % If so, why are you the first researcher in the universe who consider it ?
  % If not, why did you think that you could bring an original contribution ?

  My internship focuses on an algorithm proposed by Antoine Amarilli, Pierre
  Bourhis, Stefan Mengel and Matthias Niewerth~\cite{ICDT19}, it allows to
  enumerate all matches of a regexp with a constant delay, and a preprocessing
  linear in the size of the automata (complexity factors dependant of the
  size of the regular expression being considered as constants).

  No implementation was provided for this algorithm yet, and it seemed that
  some new issues would appear while trying to implement the algorithm, for
  example the memory cost of a naive implementation of the algorithm would
  quickly exceed the typical memory available on a personal computer.
